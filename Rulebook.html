<h1>Taco Tuesday</h1>

<p>If the day is Tuesday, all players are now tacos. Refer to the Taco Action table below for combat rules.

<h1>Actions</h1>

<p>At the beginning of each combat Round, units are given Action Points (AP) equal to their Agility. Combat
	then proceeds in Phases. In each Phase, Units may spend AP to perform a single Action.</p>

<p>Actions are performed in order of highest to lowest initiative. Ties are broken by highest remaining AP,
	then highest Focus, then whichever attribute players feel best fits the situation. A Phase ends only
	when each unit has agreed that it should, and so does a Round.</p>

<p>Some Actions can only be performed in certain Phases (see below). In general, Odd Phases are for movement
	actions, Even Phases are for attack actions.</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Action</th>
		<th>Cost</th>
		<th>Condition</th>
	</tr>
	<template v-for="action of model.actions">
		<tr>
			<td><b>{{action.action}}</b></td>
			<td>{{action.cost}}</td>
