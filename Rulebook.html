            <p>The basic to-hit/check type roll is d12-d12, we’ll just call it Roll, it represents uncertainty. A roll of -11, -10, or -9 will always fail (extra punishments should also be metered out to those who roll the least likely of the critical failures), while a roll of +9 will always succeed, 10 will have double effect, and 11 will have triple effect. A character starts with 4 in each of the base attributes (STR/DEX/INT) with 4-6 points to allocate as they choose (4 is standard, 6 is quite a bit more powerful and complex).</p>
            <p>The rest of their attributes will be figured from their base attributes. Agility is equal to their Strength plus their Dexterity (+-Liberty/Burden) and determines how many Action Points (AP) a character will be given at the start of a turn. Focus is equal to their Intellect plus their Dexterity (+-Clarity/Trauma) and determines how much Initiative a character will be given at the start of a turn. Body is equal to twice a character’s Strength while Will is equal to their Strength plus their Intellect, each determines how much damage a character can withstand before their Burden and Trauma become too great to continue to act.</p>
            <p>They may then choose any basic equipment that they’d like. The more benefits they get from equipment, the greater of a Load it will be. If a character’s Strength exceeds their Load, they will be considered to be at that much Liberty, which will add to their Agility. If a character’s Load exceeds their Strength, they will be considered to be under that much Burden, which will subtract from their Agility, Offense, and Defense. Additionally, movement actions will cost +½ their Burden and -½ their Liberty. </p>
            <p>Then, they may choose any skills or spells that they like. The more benefits they get from skills and spells, the more Experience they will have. If a character has more Intellect than they do Experience, they are considered to have that much Clarity, which will add to their Focus. If a character has more Experience than they do Intellect, they are considered to have that much Trauma, which will subtract from their Focus.</p>

        <h4>Power</h4> Power can always be calculated thusly: The maximum possible result on the dice cannot exceed twice the power, and the total amount of dice rolled must equal the power divided by 4, rounded up. As long as both of those guidelines are abided by, you may use whichever combination of dice is most convenient for you. So between 1 and 4 power, only 1 die may be used. Between 5 and 8, any combination of two dice whose largest faces total no more than twice the power must be used. Etc. The web application will always show you the configurations that use the least d2s and d4s.

        <h3>Skills </h3> 
        
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p>A starting character may have had any amount of Experiences which taught them skills and spells. Each Experience learning a skill grants a bonus equal to ½ of the attribute governing that skill (STR/DEX/INT), rounded up. A character may have a maximum of 2 Experiences learning skill, reaching a maximum of 100% the value of its governing attribute. A character can only learn spells for which they possess the skill in Magery, and each spell requires an Experience of its own. If a character has more Intellect than they do Experience, they are considered to have that much Clarity, which will add to their Focus.</p>

        <p>If a character has more Experience than they do Intellect, they are considered to have that much Trauma, which will subtract from their Focus. Whenever a character does a non-combat action with an interesting possibility for failure, the GM should decide which skills are being tested and against what obstacles and then the acting character should roll d12-d12 and add their relevant skills to the result. Whenever the obstacle is another character’s skill, the passive opposition for that obstacle shall be at least as high as the opposing skill. For example, if character is trying to sell something for more than it’s worth, they may succeed if their Roll+Guile is equal to or greater than the buyer’s Acuity, or potentially their Roll+Acuity+Craft to see if the item is of shoddy make, or potentially their Acuity+Culture to see if the item is common.</p>

        <p>When a skill is purchased or at some time during play, it should be expected that the player think about exactly what experiences led to the development of that skill. Write a short blurb (or a long one, who cares) about the nature of the character’s experience with the use of that skill with the intention that the blurb narrows the scope of that skill a little bit. This is especially important when multiple players have taken the same skill at similar levels to help differentiate their abilities a little bit. For example, when you buy the Culture skill, think about what cultures that character is actually experienced with: are they a rogue familiar with the culture of low-lives/tramps/vagabonds, did they find themselves moving information for nobles and are now passing familiar with courtly graces? Or are they a historian or researcher of some kind superficially familiar with a wide range of rare cultures? If you don’t want the scope of your skill to be narrow, because your character concept is that of somebody of great breadth of abilities and learnedness, that’s fine, you need only make sure that whoever has the most specifically appropriate blurb associated with a skill be the one who is tested in a given situation, even if their skill is worse.</p>

        <p>Skills can be used to Overcome Obstacles, meaning, avoid an interesting possible failure outcome of one of their in-game actions, or they can be used to Create or Negate an Advantage or Disadvantage.</p>

        <h2>Combat</h2>

        <h3>Tactical Values</h3> 
        
        Tactical Values are numbers which represent the various special conditions and circumstances which can be exploited on the battlefield. They often depend heavily on who you’re targeting, so only calculate your Tactical Values as they’re called for. The Tactical Values are:
        
        <ul>
            <li>Charge is equal to the amount of hexes you moved in a straight line since the previous phase.</li>

            <li>High Ground is equal to the difference in elevation between your target and you.</li>
        
            <li>Range is equal to the amount of hexes between you and your target.</li>
        
            <li>Flanking is equal to the the distance around you are from your target’s front hexes.</li>
        
            <li>Engagement is equal to the total remaining AP of figures whose front hexes you are in.</li>
        
            <li>Velocity is equal to the total hexes you’ve moved this turn.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Wounds and Stuns</h4>
        
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p>Whenever damage is dealt, record the amount as a Wound unless the damage was specified to only inflict a Stun (spell costs mostly). The amount by which the total of your Wounds and Stuns exceeds your Will directly contributes toward your Trauma. The amount by which your Wounds exceed your Body directly contributes toward your Burden. A Wound or Stun is considered Injurious if it exceeds your Strength, contributing an additional 1/3 of its value to either your Burden or Trauma, respectively, for the entire time it remains recorded. Wounds can only be healed if a treatment check is passed, and the amount of characters allowed to contribute to the bonus to the roll should be limited by the size of the Wound being treated. No more than one character should be able to contribute to a the treatment of a Wound smaller than a 6, but the conditions of the fiction may vary.</p> 
=======
        <p>Whenever damage is dealt, record the amount as a Wound or Stun. Wounds penalize a figure's Body and Will, while a Stun only penalizes a figure's Will. The attack is considered Injurious if it deals more damage than the target's Strength. If the attacker calls a hit location, then, if his successful roll is an even number, he hits that location. If the hit location is the head, and the attack is Injurious, reduce the target's Intellect by 1 until they've spent 20 AP. If the hit location is a limb and the damage is Injurious, reduce the target's Dexterity by 1 until they've spent 20 AP. If the hit location is the body, reduce the target's Strength by 1 until they've spent 20 AP.</p> 
>>>>>>> 4630c9d206896412fff11597714cc526291200b3

        <p>When a figure’s Will is negative, it contributes to their Trauma. When their Body is negative, it contributes to their Burden. When a figure's Will goes below 0 by an amount equal to their Will, a pugilism referee would stop the fight. When a figure's Body goes below 0 by an amount equal to their Body, most doctors would assume that they are dead.</p> 
        
        <h4>Initiative</h4>
        
       <p>At the start of a round of combat, each figure or their leader is secretly awarded Initiative equal to Roll+Focus. Each figure may then, secretly, spend that initiative making Preparations for the round. Preparations grant bonuses that last until the end of the round. The remaining initiatives will determine the order in which figures will act during the round. If Roll+Focus is a negative number, that figure and its group must sell preparations until their Initiative equals 0-2. These parties have been caught so off guard that they receive penalties until the end of the round. Combat values below 1 cannot be sold, but Agility can be sold lower than that.</p>

                <th> Preparations </th>

        <h4>Actions</h4>

        <p>At the beginning of each round of combat, after initiatives have been revealed, figures are given Action Points (AP) equal to their Agility. Combat
            then proceeds in Phases. In each Phase, figures may spend AP to perform a single Action. The minimum cost to do an action is 1 AP. Unspent AP at the end of each round is considered passed, and cannot be used.</p>

        <p>Actions are performed in order of highest to lowest initiative. Ties are broken by highest remaining AP,
            then highest Focus, then whichever attribute players feel best fits the situation. A Phase ends only
            when each figure has agreed that it should, and so does a Round.</p>

        <p>Some Actions can only be performed in certain Phases (see below). In general, Odd Phases are for movement
            actions, Even Phases are for attack actions.</p>
