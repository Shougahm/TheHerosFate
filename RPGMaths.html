            <td>This spell controls doors, gates, etc., and can be used in two opposite ways: to hold something closed or to open it. A door held by a LOCK spell can be opened only by a KNOCK or by physical destruction, a KNOCK will negate one LOCK spell OR open one ordinary lock. A door held by two physical locks and three LOCK spells would require five KNOCK spells to open it. Cost to cast this spell, either as LOCK or KNOCK, is 2 WL. NOTE: Some things (like a ton of sand, or a troll holding it) will close a door in the face of any KNOCK. A successful KNOCK spell will NEVER trigger traps. A failed KNOCK spell will ALWAYS trigger any traps that opening the door would have. A KNOCK will not affect a spell-created GATE. It IS possible to pick a lock held by a LOCK spell. Each LOCK spell on a door adds one disadvantage to ONE lock on that door (the GM decides which one). If a lock is secured by two LOCK spells, it takes  dice to open. Opening it voids the spells. If a door has no locks on it, a LOCK spell makes it harder to push open. No more than five LOCK spells may be cast on one door, no matter how many locks it has on it. A LOCK lasts until something removes it or the door is opened — except that a mage may pass through his own LOCK spells without removing them.</td>

A figure who moves through a fire hex, or is in a hex when a mage creates fire there, takes 2 damage of damage. A figure which ends its turn in a fire hex takes 2 damage and suffers -2 DX next turn. The effects of fire hexes are cumulative within a turn, but armor and protective spells DO work, Example: A figure moves through 2 fire hexes (4 damage) and stops in a third one to attack (4 more damage). The protection given by that figure's armor and spells are taken from the total of 8 damage to see how much damage the figure actually took from the fire. The damage takes effect as soon as the protection is used up. A mage may also use this spell to produce controlled fire in his own or an adjacent hex. He could light his own cigar, a friend's torch, or an enemy's beard.</td>

This spell has NO EFFECT against non-missile attacks. Cost: 2 WL, plus 1 each turn it is maintained.
