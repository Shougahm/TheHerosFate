		<!-- Each unit is given an amount of Action Points (AP) equal to their Agility at the beginning of the first Phase of a Round of combat. During each phase, units take turns spending AP one action at time in order of highest initiative to lowest, and then, in case of ties, in order of highest remaining AP to lowest, then in order of highest Focus to lowest (at this point you can feel free to compare whatever attributes you want to break ties, think about the situation and use your best judgement). Each phase ends only when each unit has agreed that it should, and so does the Round. Each option on the action table will specify what type of Phase you are allowed to take that action on. In general, Odd phases are for movement actions, Even phases are for attack actions. -->

        <p>At the beginning of each combat Round, units are given Action Points (AP) equal to their Agility. Combat then proceeds in Phases. In each Phase, Units may spend AP to perform a single Action.</p>
        
        <p>Actions are performed in order of highest to lowest initiative. Ties are broken by highest remaining AP, then highest Focus, then whichever attribute players feel best fits the situation. A Phase ends only when each unit has agreed that it should, and so does a Round.</p>
        
        <p>Some Actions can only be performed in certain Phases (see below). In general, Odd Phases are for movement actions, Even Phases are for attack actions.</p>
